sweep thresholds of decision rules to see effects.
see if there's more variation within one landscape or
across landscapes. Then see how many landscapes we have to use.

3/15/04 - mzellner

Realized that the threshold for isRolling was too low, and with 
heterogeneous elevation, isRolling was always true. Changed threshold
to 0.3, and will run again experiments with heterogeneous elevation
only, and with all three heterogeneous maps.

- Fix zoning at 1,1, and then vary landscape by adding one heterogeneous
  layer at a time, and then have all three combined. Only low-high income
  is swept. Use test10.ctrl
- Fix heterogeneous landscape (3 layers), sweep policy with low-high income. Use test11.ctrl
- Fix landscape with heterogeneous forest, sweep policy, with low-high income. Use test11.ctrl

OK, preparing new set of maps, where heterogeneous landscape is mirrored in both
townships:

elevation-heterogeneous-mirror.txt
water-heterogeneous-mirror.txt
forest-heterogeneous-mirror.txt

Go back to using test10.ctrl and test11.ctrl.
Logging on to complesso...

3/11/04 - mzellner

The results look good, but I think that the landscape is heterogeneous enough, that
we need to test all the combinations of policy. So need to run fixed forest-hetero
landscape and all hetero landscape varying policy for combinations that are not
included in test11.ctrl. Need to create test12.ctrl, based on test11.ctrl.

Logging on to complesso...
cd Sluce/aag/policyModel/repastCode/sluce/ARMSR/

Have all of them be heterogeneous:
cp water-heterogeneous-scale.txt water.txt
cp elevation-heterogeneous.txt elevation.txt
cp forest-heterogeneous-scale2.txt forest.txt

Run test12.ctrl to sweep zoning and income:

Change to heterogeneous forest, and run test12.ctrl:

OK, I think I'm pretty much done with all experiments. Now I'll run significance
tests, to see the differences between townships in terms of tax base and forest.

There may be a problem with the fact that one township has more forest than the
other. May need to re-run experiments with townships having mirror landscapes,
as per Rick's suggestion. Will discuss with the group.

- Fix zoning at 1,1, and then vary landscape by adding one heterogeneous

- Fix landscape with heterogeneous forest, sweep policy, with low-high income. Use test11.ctrl

OK, so I have to run again the experiments that used heterogeneous forest with
correct maps, and use the new water maps for experiments I could not run
yesterday. The heterogeneous maps needed are:

water-heterogeneous-scale.txt (needed to be scaled because of thresholds)
forest-heterogeneous-scale.txt (idem)
elevation-heterogeneous.txt (did not need to be scaled, because there are no thresholds)

So all the flat experiments and the experiments with only elevation-heterogeneous.txt
are fine. I.e. experiment-54 and experiment-55 are fine, but experiment-56 and
experiment-57 should be discarded.

Logging on to complesso...

3/9/04 - mzellner

Put all the data in experiment-results1a.txt in this directory. Saw that income
is the main demographic factor affecting the measures we're looking at.
I'm going to run a few sample runs to show the effects of landscape, in
combination with zoning, but not sure which to run. I'll consult with the
group.

Arrggg, just discovered that the heterogeneous maps were wrong. Need to make
new ones and start over with the heterogeneous runs.

New set of experiments:
- Change move out rate to 0.0
- Derek is generating new heterogeneous maps. Will use those.
- Fix zoning at 1,1, and then vary landscape by adding one heterogeneous
  layer at a time, and then have all three combined. Only low-high income
  is swept. Use test10.ctrl
- Fix landscape with heterogeneous forest, sweep policy, with low-high income. Use test11.ctrl
- Fix heterogeneous landscape (3 layers), sweep policy with low-high income. Use test11.ctrl

Then try to figure out what intuitions we can derive from these runs.
Create tables for townships.

Need to send command runs for Rick, for zoning = 3,3
nice -5 /users/mzellner/Sluce/aag/policyModel/repastCode/sluce/ARMSR/bin/batchrun.sh zonedMinLotSize0=3 zonedMinLotSize1=3 demogrIncome=0.5 stopT=300
nice -5 /users/mzellner/Sluce/aag/policyModel/repastCode/sluce/ARMSR/bin/batchrun.sh zonedMinLotSize0=3 zonedMinLotSize1=3 demogrIncome=0.2 stopT=300

OK, I don't have water, there's some error in the file that Derek sent.
So, I'll start with running zoning = 1,1 and sweep income with flat, 
elevation and forest.
Then, continue with fixed forest, and varying zoning and income.
When water ready, do zoning = 1,1 with water, and all heterogeneous,
sweeping income.
Continue with all heterogeneous and run all zoning combinations, 
sweeping income.

Bill just found a bug in the code. Need to check out new version of code
before starting again.

OK, starting now:
First, copy flat maps to defaults:
cp water-flat.txt water.txt
cp elevation-flat.txt elevation.txt
cp forest-flat.txt forest.txt

Now, start running test10.ctrl with these maps. Need to wait till it's done
to run with the other maps.

cd Sluce/aag/policyModel/repastCode/sluce/ARMSR/

Made a mistake in the control file:
ReadControlFile: Error parsing control file line: (zonedMinLotSize0 zonedMinLotSize1) (1 1) (1 2) (1 3) (2 2) (2 3) (3 3)

Re-run... Still experiment-57


#$%%^^^ I forgot to change the maps!!!!!!!! Anyway, now I have the water map as well.
So let's start all over, and in order...

More errors. Will convert again. Will run experiments tomorrow...

Trying drone

nice -5 /users/mzellner/Sluce/aag/policyModel/repastCode/sluce/ARMSR/bin/batchrun.sh iPFN=/users/mzellner/Sluce/aag/policyModel/repastCode/sluce/ARMSR/expdata/experiment-15/experiment-15.in S=273562215 rN=29  demogrKids=0.5 demogrIncome=0.5 demogrEnv=0.1

So what seems to be happening is that Drone tries to read a map in its own
directory, and since there aren't any, then it generates a default which then
allows for development to occur. Rick suggested creating a new parameter that
specifies the directory in which the maps should be found. I'll set that
directory to be /users/mzellner/Sluce/aag/policyModel/repastCode/sluce/ARMSR/,
and add that to each file name in Model.java.

Let's first make sure that if we include the directory, Drone would produce
the expected results. Yes, it's working in gui. Now try running drone.

~rlr/Drone/drone-linux  test6.ctrl

NOW, it's working. OK, so we need to create this parameter. And need
to change control files to add this parameter! Done.

Now start running all over again, and after that, with new maps that Derek
created. Check them out first.

With flat maps:

Shoot, it didn't work because I entered the directory name in the control files
in "", so it's not reading the maps. Change control files.

Let's try with test7.ctrl first, and then go down to test2.ctrl.
Now it's working! Run them all again.

3/3/04 - mzellner

Following recommendations below, I'm running in gui mode with flat maps, to see
different outputs and explanations. The changes on water restrictions have not
been implemented, yet, but it doesn't matter (unless there's a bug) because
there's no water.

1. Zoning = 1,1. Basically, there's development all around the roads of both
   CS and HS. This is reasonable, considering the rules that CS or HS will most
   likely be developed around roads, while other farms not adjacent to roads
   won't be built. I assume the tax base is similar (forgot to check).
2. Zoning = 1,2. Basically the same, except that CS are only developed in
   the township that allows such density. Interestingly, the tax base is much
   greater for denser township. Again, this may also relate to the weight we
   assign to each person, but we're saying high income pay double low
   income. Is that realistic? Asked the group. Joan replied:
   "right - based on the assessed valuation of their property.  We're looking
   at less than $250K, vs. more than $400K.  On the average, that's at least
   double in property taxes."
3. Zoning = 1,3. As expected, there is only development along the roads of
   only one township.
4. Zoning = 2,3. As expected, only hs in one township.
5. Zoning = 3,3. As expected, no development.

The question is, should there be any difference if demographics change?
My intuition is that there shouldn't, except in the tax base, when
proportion of low income increases. No, it should also make a difference
because of other preferences associated with the type of group they belong to.
So need to run all of them. So if for some reason, a group defined by a 
characteristic other than income prefers a certain sub type, which can
only be developed in one township, there will be a different result in
tax base. Wow, changing income makes a VERY different pattern, when zoning
is 1,2.

OK, so to start running the experiments, I need to copy the *-flat.txt maps
into *.txt maps (the default name written in Model.java).

Once I have the other maps, I'll create new directories and copy the code
to each, then copy the corresponding map name to *.txt.

So let's start running experiments!

Use any of the above.

I MADE A TYPO IN THE CONTROL FILES!!! Now I have to correct and
start all over.... (grrrrr).



Let's start again. Then check that when zoning = 3,3 there's no income.
It's ok when I run it in gui, but I'm not sure that it's doing the same
when running with drone.

There's a bug somewhere. When running with drone, though
zoning is 3 (therefore no development can occur), income
is greater than zero, which is impossible. This does not
occur when running in gui mode.

Running time is approx. 30 mins.

re # cases in a control file:
it basically depends on how long it takes to run.
you want the experiment to finish in some reasonable
lenght of time (eg < 12 hours for sure).

3/2/04 - mzellner

After our meeting today, we will run the following experiments, to start with:

1. Start with flat landscape maps:
   - elevation = 0.5
   - forest = 0.0
   - water = 0.0

   And constant demographics:
   - Env = 0.05
   - High_Income = 0.5
   - W_Kids = 0.5

   Just vary zoning, through following cases (twnshp0,twnshp1):
   - 1,1
   - 1,2
   - 1,3
   - 2,2
   - 2,3
   - 3,3

Using the elevation-flat.txt, water-flat.txt
and forest-flat.txt maps.

2. Repeat above with heterogeneous landscape maps, adding one at a time:
   - elevation = 0.5 (any variation)
   - forest = 25% cells over 50% threshold of forest
   - water = 5% cells over 1% threhsold of water
   These maps will have same degree of spatial autocorrelation, but
   different degrees of correlation among them, as follows:
   - elevation negatively correlated to water (-0.5)
   - water positively correlated to forest (+0.5)

Change map names.

3. Repeat 1 and 2, changing demographics:

   all combinations of:
   - Env = 0.05, 0.2
   - High_Income = 0.2, 0.5
   - W_Kids = 0.2, 0.5

These 3 tests will use test2.ctrl through test7.ctrl. Just remember to 
change the names of the maps in the code when using heterogeneous layers.

After correcting a few things, will try running experiments again. Using the
same control file as yesterday..

Is this fast? Let me check the files, to see if there are errors...
No errors.

Try to run script files on reports:
/users/rlr/Scripts/getAvgColsOverDirs.pl -c1,2,3,4 -f"report.*" -v expdata/experiment-4/zMLS*  > outfile

It works, but it's probably taking the first lines of the report file 
into consideration. Oh, hold on a second! It's also taking into consideration
the report.xml.* files! I wonder how to switch that off.

Let's try this:
/users/rlr/Scripts/getAvgColsOverDirs.pl -c1,2,3,4 -e"# end" -f"report.*" -v expdata/experiment-4/zMLS*  > outfile
This seems to work, and it may actually leave out the report.xml.* because
they don't have a "# end" marker. Is this right. Wait a minute, the columns
don't seem to be working... Let's try this:
/users/rlr/Scripts/getAvgColsOverDirs.pl -c1,2,3,4 -e"# end" -f"report.*" -v expdata/experiment-4/  > outfile

Interesting, only this is produced:
# Average data vs time        Wed Feb 25 18:22:40 EST 2004
# From directories: expdata/experiment-4/
# FilePattern report.*
# Column number in files: 1,2,3,4

So I may need to specify each directory...
/users/rlr/Scripts/getAvgColsOverDirs.pl -c1,2,3,4 -e"# end" -f"report.*" -v expdata/experiment-4/zMLS0=1-zMLS1=1  > outfile

It's printing only one column! Is it making an average of the columns?
I think it's only printing the first one. Still, do I want the whole time
series? Probably not. I just want end of runs.

So what we need is a script like getAvgEquil, that averages across last time
step. Let's see...

/users/rlr/Scripts/getEquilAvgsFromDirs.pl -c1,2,3,4 -e"# end" -l299-300 -f"report.*" -d"expdata/experiment-4"

OK, got all zeros... That's right! It's t=299 but for the script, it's 298.
Let's see...
/users/rlr/Scripts/getEquilAvgsFromDirs.pl -c1,2,3,4 -e"# end" -l298-299 -f"report.*" -d"expdata/experiment-4"

OK, now I have values! Print to a file, so that it's easier to see.
/users/rlr/Scripts/getEquilAvgsFromDirs.pl -c1,2,3,4 -e"# end" -l298-299 -f"report.*" -d"expdata/experiment-4" > outfile

This doesn't look right at all. The last values are around 600 for income in
the last time step (column 1). Here it shows an average of 150. I'm not sure
what's going on. Asked Bill and Rick.


Now I'm trying extreme values, to make sure this works. Try running with
test-xtrm1.in file, which has zoning set for zero for both townships.
Let's see if this works...

ant run -DIF=test-xtrm1.in
No, it doesn't. -DIF is not right. Let's see like this...

ant run -PF=test-xtrm1.in

And I just found out that Bill has been working on reading par file, 
but doesn't work yet. So, let's see if this works:

ant run -DzonedMinLotSize0=0

Nope, so I'll just type in the values in the GUI. So, first try
with both townships zoning for 0. Anything could be built. Now let's try with
min lot size 16 for both. Nothing is developed, as expected.
The way it's set up, if the township zones for bigger lots than the min
lot size of each sub type, then that sub type cannot be developed, even though
some lots may end up being larger than the min size because of adjacency.
Now try minLotSize of 0 and 16. Works fine, development only in one township.

Look at demographics now. Try first with all params set to 0. A remnant and
a hort are subdivided, but cannot be developed. Reason: There are no high
income people that can buy them, and given landscape characteristics, these
are the only ones that can be developed.
Now have all demographics set to 1. All developed and filled up, I think even
faster than with other settings.

Generate other maps now. Use the "twin peaks." 
Change zoning to be the same in both.

So first, generate the maps. I'll need to be very careful with this. Let
me see if I can change the code so that it's easier to change the map names.
Done, now use genMaps.pl to generate maps.

Run it /users/mzellner/Sluce/Scripts/genMap.pl > forest-peaks.txt
Run it /users/mzellner/Sluce/Scripts/genMap.pl > water-peaks.txt
Run it /users/mzellner/Sluce/Scripts/genMap.pl > elevation-peaks.txt

Now use these new maps, one at a time, to see how it changes. Make sure
zoning is the same in both townships. Hmmm, not much difference just changing
to forest-peaks. Besides, there are no country subs! Let's add the water-peaks.
Wow! That really made a difference! Practically no development. Let's use flat
forest now. Apparently, water makes all the difference. Probably because
it prevents development. That doesn't happen with forest. Let's try
elevation. I'm not sure I see a difference, but it seems to be following
the lines of elevation. Let's combine it with forest-peaks. I'm not sure how
it's different. We may want to use yet different maps. I'll make new ones like
Bill had generated (*-incl.txt). The patterns look different, but not
sure. Water is the main restriction. Why aren't there any country subs formed?
Let me put all back on. Still not there. Could it be the roads?
Let me check. Nope...

Maybe it's the restrictions regarding water. That wasn't there before
Bill left. We'll need to change the value of some of these things (go 
to notes.txt for details).

Repeating above, with new threshold for presence/absence of water (0.65 acres).
Running all flat, plus simple road, t=100.
Now change water to water-peaks.txt. Almost nothing can be developed! OK,
let's increase the threshold of water preventing development to 0.9.

Running an experiment, just to try it out. It's changing only zoning on a 
homogeneous landscape.

Why is starting with experiment-2? I though I had deleted experiment-1...
Maybe I didn't.

Uh-oh, I just got an e-mail with

This doesn't look good. Checking if there are errors.
Of course, this is what I found:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ARMSR/BatchModel

Will ask Rick what this means.

I had forgotten to change the path in bin/batchrun.sh. I fixed it. Try again...
