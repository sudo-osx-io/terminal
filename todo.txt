**3/3/04 added by wrand
there appears to be a bug where if it can't correctly create a lot in
a subdivision it doesn't create any lots make sure we look through it
and have it create one big lot if nothing else, or crash if
divideIntoLots doesn't create any lots

Features
--------
**4/30/04 added by mzellner
test that measure of sub type per township is correct (Moira already did).

**4/16/04 added by mzellner
add new roads

**4/12/04 added by wrand
move clearForest from Subdivision to Cell

**4/09/04 added by mzellner and wrand
sweep thresholds of decision rules to see effects.

**3/3/04 added by wrand
test the water condition, that the amount of a lot made up of water is
not used in the size of the lot

**2/25/04 added by mzellner (rlriolo)
make all constants into variables defined at the top of class (especially
in Subdivision). (Worked on thresholds in Sub, and maps in Model). Any others?

**2/24/04 added by mzellner (rlriolo)
Observe how time to run scales with world size

**2/23/04 added by mzellner
PRIORITY: check that conditions for development (water+forest, and forest acreage) are
right (Bill). Moira changed older conditions and changed back to original (03/02/04).

**2/23/04 added by mzellner
make roadspace always binary

**2/19/04 added by wrand
add checks to make sure QualitySpaces match up in size with the world

**2/18/04 added by wrand
exclude lots that residents can't afford from their selection criteria

**2/17/04 added by wrand
add printhelp to ARMS-R

**2/17/04 added by mzellner
include adjacency by checking number of subs of each type surrounding current
sub (represents NIMBYism).

**2/17/04 added by mzellner
change probability of sale of farm with time.

**2/10/04 added by wrand
deal with splitting subdivision types

**2/10/04 added by wrand
change residents color so that they are simply a darker color of
their subdivision

**2/03/04 added by mzellner
need to make code more generic to accept any number of townships and
zoning restrictions.

**1/29/04 added by wrand
set default parameters to realistic ones as specified by Monday meeting

**1/12/04 added by wrand
modify create farms to respect township boundaries

**1/8/04 added by wrand
add rural lots

**12/09/03 added by wrand
modify sellLots so that it doesn't have to just keep generating random
lots and seeing if the resident can move into them

Cleanup
-------
**2/19/04 added by wrand

change developFarms, etc. so they are not called if there is no
appropriate land type

**12/05/03 added by wrand

reset all private static ints, when the world resets like subID right
now they keep accumulating

**2/17/04 added by wrand
move all qualityspace references to cell level, this is the
clearforest in subdivision as well as the subdivision level envtl calculations

**2/17/04 added by wrand
modify parameter file tests to run with the dronified version.

**12/09/03 added by wrand

have moira look over evaluatelots routine with you

**12/18/03 added by wrand

clean up divideIntoLots routine right now its kludgy

Finished
--------
**3/15/04 added by mzellner (rlriolo)
add output measure to indicate how many subs of each type exist at each
time step.

done, 4/30/04 by mzellner

**4/09/04 added by mzellner and wrand

**4/16/04 added by wrand and mzellner
add check to panoramic view

done, 4/16/04 by mzellner

done, 4/16/04 by mzellner

be double between 0 and 1. Elevation will be double with no maximum
value specified.

done, 4/16/04 by mzellner

**4/09/04 added by mzellner and wrand
Change panoramic view method to check cells in a lot, and determine if
it has panoramic view when any cell has over 50% of its neighboring cells
at least 62 ft. lower (20 m).

done, 4/16/04 by mzellner and wrand

**3/1/04 added by wrand
PRIORITY: change restriction on building so that it simply adds whatever is not
covered by water to the size of the lot. Same as: **2/23/04 added by mzellner
PRIORITY: check that water restriction on building is right (Bill)

done, 3/3/04 by wrand

**3/1/04 added by wrand
PRIORITY: modify water check to 1% for water presence

done, 3/2/04 by mzellner

PRIORITY: comment out the condition
in developer and go back to the original decision process, (presence /
absence of water, and 50% or more wooded or rolling), in determineSubType

done, 3/2/04 by mzellner

**2/24/04 added by mzellner (rlriolo)
make size of water for determineSubType a static final public class variable
in Model.java  so that we can easily change it to be a parameter.
(ie, don't stick the 0.5 constant down in the methods.)
